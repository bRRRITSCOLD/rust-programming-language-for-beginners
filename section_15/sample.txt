Rick, is this a Saw thing?
Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators?
Hmmm, human music.
Not so fast Morty.
You heard your mom.
We've got adventures to go on, Morty.
Just you and me.
And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad.
You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.
There's a lesson here and I'm not going to be the one to figure it out.
Puh rum pum pow!
It's like the N word and the C word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews.
Uh ohhh!
Somersault jump!
You're growing up fast, Morty.
You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a quick solo adventure to go on and this one will not be directed by Ron Howard.
Puh rum pum pow! Oh my god, how could I not see this coming?
My lust, my greed! I deserve thiiiiii- Ladies, let's get out of here.
I haven't learned a thiiiiiing!
Allahu blehhhh Akbar!
It's a device Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams Morty.
Its just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
Oh boy, so you actually learned something today?
What is this? Full House?
I was living in the moment all day, and it kept getting me killed by Nazis.
I think you need to think ahead and live in the moment.
Flip the pickle over.
Lookin' good!
Pickle!
